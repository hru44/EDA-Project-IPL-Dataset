1. SUM
The SUM function is the first must-know formula in Excel. It usually aggregates
values from a selection of columns or rows from your selected range.
=SUM(number1, [number2], …)
Example:
=SUM(B2:G2) – A simple selection that sums the values of a row.
=SUM(A2:A8) – A simple selection that sums the values of a column.
=SUM(A2:A7, A9, A12:A15) – A sophisticated collection that sums values from
range A2 to A7, skips A8, adds A9, jumps A10 and A11, then finally adds from
A12 to A15.
=SUM(A2:A8)/20 – Shows you can also turn your function into a formula.


2. Average
The AVERAGE function should remind you of simple averages of data such as
the average number of shareholders in a given shareholding pool.
=AVERAGE(number1, [number2], …)
Example:
=AVERAGE(A1:A10) – Shows a simple average, also similar to (SUM(A1: A10)/9)


3. COUNT
The COUNT function counts all cells in a given range that contains only numeric
values.
=COUNT(value1, [value2], …)
Example:
COUNT(A:A) – Counts all values that are numerical in A column. However, it
doesn’t use the same formula to count rows.
COUNT(A1:C1) – Now it can count rows.

4. COUNTA
Like the COUNT function, COUNTA counts all cells in a given rage. However, it
counts all cells regardless of type. That is, unlike COUNT that relies on only
numerics, it also counts dates, times, strings, logical values, errors, empty
string, or text.
=COUNTA(value1, [value2], …)
Example:
COUNTA(A:A) – Counts all cells in column A regardless of type. However, like
COUNT, you can’t use the same formula to count rows.


5. IF
The IF function is often used when you want to sort your data according to a
given logic. The best part of the IF formula is that you can embed formulas and
function in it.
=IF(logical_test, [value_if_true], [value_if_false])
Example:
=IF(C2<D3, ‘TRUE,’ ‘FALSE’) – Checks if the value at C3 is less than the value at
D3. If the logic is true, let the cell value be TRUE, else, FALSE
=IF(SUM(C1:C10) > SUM(D1:D10), SUM(C1:C10, SUM(D1:D10)) – An example
of a complex IF logic. First, it sums C1 to C10 and D1 to D10, then it compares
the sum. If the sum of C1 to C10 is greater than SUM of D1 to D10, then it
makes the value of a cell equal to the sum of C1 to C10. Otherwise, it makes it
the SUM of D1 to D10. 

6. TRIM
The TRIM function makes sure your functions do not return errors due to
unruly spaces. It ensures that all empty spaces are eliminated. Unlike other
functions that can operate on a range of cells, TRIM only operates on a single
cell. Therefore, it comes with the downside of adding duplicated data in your
spreadsheet.
=TRIM(text)
Example:
TRIM(A4) – Removes empty spaces in the value in cell A4



7. MAX & MIN
The MAX and MIN functions help in finding the maximum number and the
minimum number in a pull of values.
=MIN(number1, [number2], …)
Example:
=MIN(B2:C11) – Finds the minimum number between column B from B2 and
column C from C2 to row 11 in both column B and C.
=MAX(number1, [number2], …)
Example:
=MAX(B2:C11) – Similarly, it finds the maximum number between column B
from B2 and column C from C2 to row 11 in both column B and C.

ADVANCED EXCEL FORMULAS


1. INDEX MATCH
Formula: =INDEX(C3:E9,MATCH(B13,C3:C9,0),MATCH(B14,C3:E3,0))
This is an advanced alternative to the VLOOKUP or HLOOKUP formulas (which
several drawbacks and limitations). INDEX MATCH is a powerful combination
of Excel formulas that will take your financial analysis and financial modeling to
the next level.
INDEX returns the value of a cell in a table based on the column and row
number.
MATCH returns the position of a cell in a row or column

2. IF combined with AND / OR
Formula: =IF(AND(C2>=C4,C2<=C5),C6,C7)

3. OFFSET combined with SUM or AVERAGE
Formula: =SUM(B4:OFFSET(B4,0,E2-1))

4. CHOOSE
Formula: =CHOOSE(choice, option1, option2, option3)

5. XNPV
Formula: =XNPV(discount rate, cash flows, dates)

6. SUMIF and COUNTIF
Formula: =COUNTIF(D5:D12,”>=21″)

7. PMT and IPMT
Formula: =PMT(interest rate, # of periods, present value)


8. LEN and TRIM
Formulas: =LEN(text) and =TRIM(text)


10. CELL, LEFT, MID and RIGHT functions

Formula
=DATE(year,month,day)

=EOMONTH(start_date, months)


– Using EOMONTH with SUMIF
SUMIFS((C3:C11),(B3:B11),”>=”&E4,(B3:B11),”<=”&EOMONTH(E4,0))


=IF(INT(YEARFRAC(A1,TODAY()))<35,”Eligible”,”Not Eligible”)


=AND(logical1, [logical2], …)
The AND function uses the following arguments:
1. Logical1 (required argument) – It is the first condition or logical value to be
evaluated.
2. Logical2 (optional requirement) – It is the second condition or logical value
to be evaluated.
